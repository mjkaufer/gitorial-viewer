# Gitorial Viewer

## Usage
To use this, enter your GitHub repo address in the first field, and the file you're trying to load in the second. For instance, viewing this repo as a Gitorial would require you to enter `mjkaufer/gitorial-viewer` in the first input and `README.md` or some other file in the second

## Things To Look Out For
This is a very simple system, and does not bother checking if the file you listed is in all of the commits. This means that it might try and load a file from a commit that doesn't have that file, when you click that commit.
